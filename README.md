### Team Plan:
**Cooperation Plan**<br>
Every person on your team is an asset. This is your chance to discover the hidden strengths and areas for growth for each team member.<br>

Describe at least:

**What are the key strengths of each person on the team?**<br>
| | |
|--|--|
|Katrina| Research,  resources, asking for help|
|Ella|collaboration, staying on track,  willing to stay till its done, asking for help|
|Rachel| committed to finishing, research, not asking for help|
|Michelle| Organization, research, not asking for help|

**How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?**<br>
For those good at asking for help, they can keep team on track, not lose time when problem is beyond 15 mins.<br>
Researchers can branch off and seek answers while team continues to work on project.<br>

**In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?**<br>
Michelle- write code, practice syntax<br>
Ella - wants to be part of the programming so that she understands the code, navigating<br>
Rachel - wants to try driving more and write code<br>
Katrina - navigating, writing code<br>

**Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?**<br>
• Morning and afternoon standups<br>
• Morning- discuss MVP for day<br>
• Afternoon- discuss what our progress and challenges<br>

**NOTE:** Undoing, Redoing, Replacing, or otherwise steamrolling the project as an individual is considered to be unacceptable. Account for the inevitable divergence of ideas, execution tasks, and assignments of duties here.

### Conflict Plan
Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

Describe at least:

**What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?**<br>
The group will discuss concerns, if unresolveable will reach out to instructor.<br>
• Take time out and come back and attempt a resolution<br>

**What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?**<br>
The person taking control might not know, so let them be aware of the situation.<br>

**How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?**<br>
Add notes to code so other team members know whats going on.
Pseudo code project before starting so we have a plan on what goes where. \*\* use TODO's\*\*<br>

**How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?**<br>
Group will discuss in standups<br>
Reach out and ask if teammate is ok? (possibly have personal things going on) what can we do to support team member?<br>

**How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?**<br>
Group will try to resolve if no resolution, the conflic will be escalated to instructor.<br>

## Communication Plan

Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.

Describe at least:

**What hours will you be available to communicate?**<br>
Katrina - all day and weekend (except for personal  appts/things)<br>
Rachel -  all day and weekend (except for personal  appts/things)<br>
Ella - all day except weekends (can still slack)<br>
Michelle - all day and weekend (except for personal  appts/things)<br>

**What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?**
slack

**How often will you take breaks?**<br>
every hour or as needed

**What is your plan if you start to fall behind?**<br>
ask for help<br>
re-evaluate MVP

**How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?**<br>
slack

**What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?**<br>
ask everyone's opinion

**How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?**<br>
Being encouraging<br>
acknowledging everyone's ideas<br>
not assuming<br>


### Work Plan
Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.

**NOTE:** While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, writing and/or committing code to the project on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks.

Describe at least:

use of pair programming and circling back with each other

**How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?**<br>
during standups we will go through and ask who feels like they can work on certain tasks<br>

**What project management tool will be used?**<br>
Trello

### Presentation Deck


### Git Process
Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks.
Describe at least:

**What components of your project will live on GitHub?**<br>
repos, images

**How will you share the repository with your teammates?**<br>
create org

**What is your Git flow?**<br>
Main <-- Staging branch <-- work branches<br>
	• possibly use first name initial + branch name

**Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:**<br>
Yes, 2 approvers

**How many people must review a PR?**<br>
2 people

**Who merges PRs?**<br>
1 of the non approvers

**How often will you merge?** <br>
\*\*merge to staging through out project, merge to main at MVP for project\*\*<br>
merge as a team<br>
after completion of tasks completed<br>
at end of day<br>

**How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?**<br>
During standups and when feature tasks are completed

### Create your Pitch
Once your team had decided on 1 or 2 favorites, prepare your pitches for submission.

**Alternatives:**
- Build a sundae
- Mouse & cheese
- Melting snowman

**What lends itself to ASCII?:**
Each pitch should contain the following information:<br>
Pitch #1(This is what was pitched during preliminary pitch meeting)

### Hangman
**Summary of idea.**
- The childhood game we all love is being re-imagined as a Python learning tool.
- This will be a texting game.
**What problem or pain point does it solve?** a. Keep it high level without going into too much detail. (3-4 sentences is enough)<br>
An entry-level tool to help beginner level Pythonistas learn Python. <br>With every language there is new terminology and concepts to learn. This project will help the beginner Pythonista learn key terminology for mastering Python basics.

#### Minimum Viable Product (MVP) definition.

**What is the minimum required for you to present on your demo day?**
The user should be able to start the game.<br>
Program generates a random “hidden” word.<br>
Tell the user if they got a correct letter or not.<br>
Display the hangman if user did not guess the correct letter.<br>
Prompt user to take another turn.<br>
Display current status.<br>
Prompt the user to play another game or quit.<br>
Display the hidden word (STRETCH: and definition).<br>
STRETCH: Play against a bot.<br>
STRETCH: Pick categories<br>
STRETCH: User can solve the puzzle at once<br>

**Persistence?:**<br> 
keep track of what user got wrong. What will need to be saved?
